# Data Science and Machine Learning ðŸ“ŠðŸš€
Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning (ML) repository, where I document my learnings through this dynamic field. Here, you'll find a collection of code snippets, projects and explorations in various programming languages, including Python, R and SQL. This repository is a living document, continuously updated as I delve deeper into the world of Data Science and ML.

## ðŸ“š Learning Resources
- Simple yet insightful code examples
- Engaging projects to apply theoretical knowledge
- Explorations into new programming languages

## ðŸ“‹ Interesting projects

- [Data Loading, Preparation, Exploration and Cleaning](https://github.com/thomazcabral/Data_Science/blob/90ed1bef23b9ab0dea902376c1cea9c3bb4a256e/Data%20Science%20with%20Python/C1%20(Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science%20in%20Python)/W2%20(Basic%20Data%20Processing%20with%20Pandas)/A2/data_manipulation.ipynb)
, by engaging in this exercise, I gained valuable experience applicable to real-world data analysis and this enhanced my proficiency in handling diverse datasets.

- [Data Representation using R](https://github.com/thomazcabral/Data_Science/tree/9faf3475a9276a4ed548aaa0e824cf9d16f558eb/R%3A%20Basics%20to%20projects/data_representation_project) , this not only demonstrates the importance of data representation in data science and machine learning, but also reflects the invaluable experience I gained in implementing and refining these techniques and helped me when I studied matplotlib, since the basics of them are almost the same.
- [Hate Speech Detection Using Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/thomazcabral/Data_Science-ML/tree/06871c266e75aa09b6d44d20611f32d00884cdf6/Deep%20learning%20-%20IF867/project) , where I could develop Deep Learning skills to identify and combat hate speech online, promoting a safer digital environment.
- [Vehicle Component Failure Prediction](https://github.com/jvlopess/VehicleComponentFailurePrediction) , where I could apply my machine learning and data science skills using real data from Stellantis.
